Bookmark Highlighter does what it says on the tin. Text links are highlighted with a blue background, and image links are highlighted with a dotted blue outline. This is a simple and effective way to see what's bookmarked among a sea of links.

This add-on allows customization in two ways:

* Basic customization - there are two preferences that can be changed to allow different colors or any CSS options.
* Advanced customization - Bookmark Highlighter tags bookmarked links and images with two CSS classes, "bmh-bookmarked-link" and "bmh-bookmarked-image". Using other Add-ons, such as Stylish, the user may override bookmarked links and images on a site-by-site basis.
